# Neonious-Node

The Neonious computational software source code.

As backend it includes

- Ethereum mining (to be then paid out in MDSIMs)

- GROMACS molecular simulations + AutoDock docking simulations
  as needed for Ambrego's business ( https://www.ambrego.com )

What is active when is coordinated by the Neonious server.

Mostly public for reference. We provide simple to use binary distributions which should preferably be used in production.


For the steps to compile, run and build a distribution, please see INSTALL.md
